Four blocks to downtown Castro, one block from downtown Noe Valley with coffee shops, restaurants and bars you won't need a car. <br>\n<br>\nLocation: We are south of the Castro, 1 block north of downtown Noe Valley, and 5 blocks west of the Mission, right in the middle of 3 high streets.<br>\n<br>\nGarden view upstairs master bedroom:<br>\n+ Temperpedic style Queen Bed<br>\n+ Desk with drawers<br>\n+ Garden view<br>\n+ Vaulted ceilings<br>\n+ 180 sq ft of luxurious room to spread out<br>\n+ Walk-in closet<br>\n<br>\nCity view upstairs master bedroom:<br>\n+ New Nectar Mattress comfortable Queen Bed<br>\n+ Reading loft<br>\n+ 170 sq ft of luxurious room to spread out<br>\n+ Fireplace<br>\n+ Walk-in closet<br>\n<br>\nThe house has two bathrooms, one shower, one bath. The upstairs bath has a huge skylight and is filled with light the entire day. <br>\n<br>\nPlease help yourself to our tea drawer or coffee and kettle. The kitchen, fridge and stove are available and you're welcome to all the jams, hot sauces, condiments and spices.<br>\n<br>\nBackyard: Take a moment to drink your tea or coffee outside on our deck by the lemon tree. There are two platforms to sit on, all surrounded by flowers and plants. The lemon tree fruits year round with a bounty of juicy Meyer lemons.<br>\n<br>\nWe are located in the heart of Noe Valley which is one block from the main drag (24th) in Noe, 1 block from a corner store, .5 miles to Whole Foods, .5 miles to the heart of the Castro and two blocks from 2 coffee shops (Philz coffee - one of the top 3 in SF), and one mile from Bart and bars in the Mission. <br>\n<br>\nPublic Transit: We have multiple options of transit. The 24 is one block away and will whisk you into the height and Divisadero shopping, The 36 will pick you up on the corner down the street, and the 48 is a block away and will take you directly to Bart. Muni is .5mi away in the Castro and I highly recommend downloading the Lyft app if you ever want a friendly inexpensive taxi. They will come directly to you at a push of a button.<br>\n<br>\nStreet parking is easy and and does not require a permit. There is no parking in the garage available.<br>\n<br>\nPlease ONLY book with us if you: <br>\n* do not smoke cigarettes <br>\n* are comfortable with self check-in    </section>", "postinginfo": "<p id=\"display-date\" class=\"postinginfo reveal\">\n                    Posted\n                    <time class=\"date timeago\" datetime=\"2020-11-19T09:58:26-0800\">\n                        2020-11-19 09:58\n                    </time>\n            </p>", "titletextonly": "Walk to Grocery | Fruit Trees | Luxury Deck | Whole House", "price": "$5,500", "mapaddress": null, "attrgroup": "<p class=\"attrgroup\">\n\n\n\n            <span class=\"shared-line-bubble\"><b>2BR</b> / <b>2Ba</b></span>\n\n\n\n\n             <span class=\"shared-line-bubble\"><b>2350</b>ft<sup>2</sup></span>\n\n    </p>", "hood": null},
